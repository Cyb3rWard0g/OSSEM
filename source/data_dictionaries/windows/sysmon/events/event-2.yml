title: 'Event ID 2: A process changed a file creation time'
description: The change **file creation time** event is registered when a file creation
  time is explicitly modified by a process. This event helps tracking the real creation
  time of a file. Attackers may change the file creation time of a backdoor to make
  it look like it was installed with the operating system. Note that many processes
  legitimately change the creation time of a file; it does not necessarily indicate
  malicious activity.
