# ETL Schema
Event fields used to define specific metadata about the event during the processing of an ETL pipeline.

## Data Fields
|Standard Name|Type|Description|Sample Value|
|---|---|---|---|
| etl_event_hash                 | string    | SHA1 hash used to note the uniqueness of the field. Could be used to make sure there are not duplicates in a database. Differs from `event_original_hash_sha1` because this field's value may be derived from concatanated sources                                                     | `379aa896e623141926b0c0f8efe5ba7b82d75cbe` | 
| etl_format_applied             | string    | Formatting or encoding applied during the ETL processing. Also referred to as CODEC in some use cases. Can be an array if multiple formats were applied/determined                                                                                                                     | `[ "sylog", "json" ]`                  | 
| etl_format_is_cef              | boolean   | During ETL processing, event is determined to be CEF (format)                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `false`                                | 
| etl_format_is_json             | boolean   | During ETL processing, event is determined to be JSON (format)                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | `true`                                 | 
| etl_format_is_syslog           | boolean   | During ETL processing, event is determined to be Syslog (format). Technically you could send data encoded in different format over syslog (ie: CEF or JSON), therefore an event/log can have this tag/field as well as other format fields                                             | `true`                                 | 
| etl_format_is_xml              | boolean   | During ETL processing, event is determined to be XML (format)                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | `true`                                 | 
| etl_host_agent_type            | string    | Type of forwarder from the client (ie: winlogbeat, nxlog, rsyslog, etc)                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `nxlog`                                |

| etl_info_tags                  | string    | Use for any additional information about an event/log during ETL/processing pipeline. Commonly, you would use this for things that are rare but happen (ie: parsing error for non conforming RFC).
